My place is close to Salems Hour, Pels Pie, Prospect Park, Midwood Flats,  and a Lil Mo Wine. My place is good for couples, solo adventurers, business travelers, and groups of 5. Although the apartment is shared I have my own separate suite with its own bathroom and private entrance removed from the common area. It's perfect for a quiet get away or an escape to get some work done. There is a large living/dining space including TV with Chromecast & HiFi speakers and full sized kitchen. The bedrooms are at opposite ends of this very spacious 2.5 bedroom, 2 bath so occupants in each bedroom won't hear each other. The couch in the living room sleeps 1.

      " \"This is a nice space where travelers can come and crash during their stay in the city. It's much cheaper and cozier than a hotel and offers the privacy and comfort that a hostel doesn't have.  Guests will have access to the bedroom, with fresh sheets and towels, as well as the adjacent bathroom. I will provide the wifi code as well.  I will be away, but my roommates will be here during that time. They are very nice and will be happy to help with questions in navigating the city, however, one works from home so it should be relatively quiet during business hours.  The UWS is a great neighborhood. I absolutely love it here. We are surrounded by some of the city's best bars and coffee shops.

      "[\"My comfy little abode in the heart of Venice, is minutes from the beach with plenty of permit free street parking. Along with a separate bathroom and spacious kitchen for easy cooking, it'll make it easy to find your rhythm and make the space yours, feeling at home in no time. It's uniquely mine and I put a lot of love into it adding my own personal touches. It's been transformed a few times and it's grown along side me for many years now. If you're looking for an upmarket, modern apartment, you might be looking in the wrong place. The studio is modest, but very cozy and welcoming with a great energy! For bare basics, it has exactly what you need. My spot is lovely and it'll be all yours if you choose to take it. No roommates, no one to answer to and no one to tip toe around. Mine is a small building with only 8 units. Unfortunately there aren't all the bells and whistles in terms of amenities, but we do have a laundry room in the building which is coin operated (coins not provided). A\"\n",
